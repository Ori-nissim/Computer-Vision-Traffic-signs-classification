## Computer vision project
This project is my documented work on a Kaggle competition in Computer vision.
The goal is to classify each traffic sign image to one of 43 classes and test your model, my model recieved 87% accuracy on 12630 test images.
I used ResNet with 34 layers, pretrained on ImageNet by PyTorch library.
My work is detailed and explained in the included notebook.
#### Python libraries used
* Mainly PyTorch and its modules
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Sklearn
